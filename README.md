Import characters from Pathbuilder to Foundry Pathfinder 2e

## About

This is inspired by the previous [pathbuilder2e-import](https://github.com/kobseryqum/foundry-pathbuilder2e-import) package, but is written afresh from the ground up, capturing some of my experience from [DDB Importer](https://github.com/MrPrimate/ddb-importer).

## Bugs and Issues

Please open bugs and issues on [github](https://github.com/MrPrimate/pathmuncher/issues/new/choose), or via the Discord channel [#pathmuncher](https://discord.gg/M6jvpfreNd).
